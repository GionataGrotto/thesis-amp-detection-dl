The goal of this project was to explore the use of neural networks for the identification and classification of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) based on their amino acid sequences. AMPs are short proteins with antimicrobial activity, playing a crucial role in innate immunity and offering potential as alternatives to traditional antibiotics.
